The moment you've all been waiting for is here...

Well, maybe not all of you, but at least some of you!
And maybe not the -exact- moment you've been waiting for,
but it's still momentous!

Yes, that's right!  uPortal is making it's debut as an
Alpha product!!!

uPortal is a fully authorized implementation of the Portal
MIP for Unix.  Currently, uPortal is being developed with
Linux users in mind, although there will eventually be
compiled versions available for most modern unix platforms.

At the moment, uPortal has a text based interface (or
a terminal based interface, if you prefer).  Now, I
will readily admit that this is a bit limiting on a
25 line terminal, but in a color XTerm, it's quite nice
looking.  In fact, even on those 25 line terminal screens
it's not so terrible since you have the added bonus of
the Portal HPBars (All 4 of them!) as well as the uptime
and mudlag indicators.  Of course, Event functionality
is also in the works.  Currently, there is limited
hp bar threshold events, but full event support will be
featured in the later beta and initial production releases.
